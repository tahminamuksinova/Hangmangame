Hangman Game
Welcome to the Hangman game! This is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. The objective of the game is to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. You have a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.

Features
Random Word Selection: The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
Hangman Visualization: A visual representation of the hangman is drawn as the player makes incorrect guesses.
Multiple Guess Options: You can guess either a single letter or the entire word at once.
Replay Option: After the game ends, you can choose to play again.
Difficulty Levels: A simple implementation with a fixed number of incorrect guesses allowed (6 tries).
Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine (Python 3.6 or later is recommended).
Clone this repository or download the hangman.py file directly.
How to Play
Run the Game: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the hangman.py file. Then, run the game with the following command:

bash
Copy code
python hangman.py
Gameplay:

The game will randomly select a word and display underscores (_) representing each letter in the word.
You will be prompted to guess a letter or the entire word.
If you guess a letter correctly, it will replace the corresponding underscores.
If you guess incorrectly, part of the hangman will be drawn.
You win if you guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn.
You lose if the hangman is fully drawn before you guess the word.
Replay:

After the game ends, you will be asked if you want to play again. Type Y to play again or N to exit.
